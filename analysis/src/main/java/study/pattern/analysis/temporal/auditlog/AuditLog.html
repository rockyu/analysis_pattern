<h1>Audit Log</h1>

<p><i>A simple log of changes, intended to be
easily written and non-intrusive.</i></p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<P>An audit log is the simplest, yet also one of the most effective
forms of tracking temporal information. The idea is that any time
something significant happens you write some record indicating what
happened and when it happened.
</P><P>An audit log can take many physical forms. The most common form is
a file. However a database table also makes a fine audit log. If you
use a file you need a format. An ASCII form helps in making it
readable to humans without special software. If it's a simple tabular
structure, then tab delimited text is simple and effective. More
complex structures can be handled nicely by XML.
</P><P><i>Audit Log</i> is easy to write but harder to read, especially as it grows
large. Occasional ad hoc reads can be done by eye and simple text
processing tools. More complicated or repetitive tasks can be
automated with scripts. Many scripting languages are well suited to
churning though text files. If you use a database table you can save
SQL scripts to get at the information.
</P><P>When you use <i>Audit Log</i> you should always consider writing out both
the actual and record dates. They are easy to produce and even though
they may be the same 99% of the time, the 1% can save your bacon. As
you do this remember that the record date is always the current
processing date.
</P>
<h2>When to use it</h2>
<P>The glory of <i>Audit Log</i> is its simplicity. As you compare <i>Audit Log</i> to
other patterns such as <a href = 'TemporalProperty.html'>Temporal Property</a> and
<a href = 'TemporalObject.html'>Temporal Object</a> you quickly realize that these
alternatives add a lot of complexity to an object model, although
these are both often better at hiding that complexity than using
<a href = 'Effectivity.html'>Effectivity</a> everywhere.
</P><P>But it's the difficulty of processing <i>Audit Log</i> that is it's
limitation. If you are producing bills every week based on
combinations of historic data, then all the code to churn through the
logs will be slow and difficult to maintain. So it all depends how
tightly the accessing of temporal information is integrated into your
regular software process. The tighter the integration, the less useful
is <i>Audit Log</i>.
</P><P>Remember that you can use <i>Audit Log</i> in some parts of the model and
other patterns elsewhere. You can also use <i>Audit Log</i> for one dimension
of time and a different pattern for another dimension. So you might
handle actual time history of a property with <a href = 'TemporalProperty.html'>Temporal Property</a> and use <i>Audit Log</i> to handle the record
history.

<h2>Example:  (Java)</h2>
<P>A simple <i>Audit Log</i> can be very simple indeed.
</P><pre>class Customer...
  private String phone;
  public String getPhone() {
    return (phone == null) ? "none" : phone;}
  public void setPhone(String arg, MfDate changeDate) {
    log (changeDate, this, "change of phone", phone, arg);
    phone = arg;
  }
  public void setPhone(String arg) {
    setPhone(arg, MfDate.today());
  }
  private static void log (MfDate validDate, Customer customer, String description, Object oldValue, Object newValue) {
    try {
      logfile().write(validDate.toString() + customer.name() + "\t" + description + 
        "\t" + oldValue + "\t" + newValue + "\t" + MfDate.today() + "\n");
      logfile().flush();
    } catch (IOException e) {throw new ApplicationException ("Unable to write to log");}
  }
</pre><P>Notice that even though the setting method
only uses the actual time, I've also added the record date
(<code>MfDate.today</code> to the log. I think it's always wise to add
both dates as it's easy to do and if you don't add it you can't
reconstitute it later.

</P><P>I'll leave the script for finding out my phone number on some
arbitrary date as an exercise for the reader. (Clearly it's too
trivial for me to write out here....)
